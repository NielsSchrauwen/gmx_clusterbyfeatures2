gmx_clusterByFeatures
=====================

It can be used to cluster the conformations in molecular dynamics trajectory using
collection of features. The features could be any quantity as a function of time
such as Projections of egienvector from PCA or dihedral-PCA, distances, angles,
channel radius etc.

Conformational Clustering
-------------------------
During the Molecular Dynamics Simulations, molecules conformations changes considerably
and identifying the conformations is very important to study the biomolecular dynamics.
